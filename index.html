  Hey, I'm Sebastian Torres and I love building beautiful websites

  About Me

  I'm a junior front-end developer lookinng for a new role in an exciting company. I focus on writing accesible HTML,
  using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can
  adapt to whatever tools are required. I'm based in Maar del Plarta, Argentina, but I'm happy working remotely and I am
  willing to move to a new location if necessary, even in another country. When I'm not coding, you'll find me outdoors.
  I love being out in nature whether that's going for a walk, or run. I'd love you to check out my work.
